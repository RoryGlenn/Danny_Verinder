Stock analysis tool
This is a simple project that helps to monitor a stock portfolio.

As a user, I can provide a list of stock ticker symbols that I want to monitor
The tool will pull data from an authoritative source and show summary details on the stock that include: current price, current shares outstanding, calculated EPS, dividend amount and yield
When you click on any stock then additional details are provided:
- links to posted financials and earning reports
- news headlines for the stock.

A second feature is that the tool should pull in the entire list of stocks and determine those that are trading for less than the value of cash that they have on hand
